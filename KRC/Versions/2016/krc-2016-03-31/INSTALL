Compiling and installing KRC
----------------------------

Tested on Debian/Ubuntu Linux, 32-bit and 64-bit

	make
	sudo make install

Installation directories for the executable, the files it requires
and man pages can be changed by editing the Makefile (near the top)
or by saying
        PREFIX=/usr/local make
        PREFIX=/usr/local make install

If you just want to try it without installing it, you can
	make
	./krc
and it will find its library files ("prelude", "lib1981" and "help/")
in local directory `krclib'

note also directory `doc' with man pages krc.1

krc has been tested with gcc, clang and tcc compilers.
Of the three, clang gives best performance, not in terms of speed
but because it leaves less (apparently no!) junk on the stack
whereas the other two do, tcc more than gcc, and that junk makes
the garbage collector uselessly preserve unused cells on the heap.
To use clang:  CC=clang make
