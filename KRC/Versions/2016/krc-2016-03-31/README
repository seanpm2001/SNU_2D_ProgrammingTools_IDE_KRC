This is my 1980 implementation of the lazy functional programming
system, Kent Recursive Calculator, translated from the original BCPL
source code into C and adapted from EMAS to Unix.

For compilation and installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

The source files in this directory use a dialect of C very close to the
style used in the original BCPL. Check the file bcpl.h for a summary of
this BCPL-like syntax.  I am grateful to Martin Guy for devising this
translation scheme and for his help in getting KRC running again.  I
remain responsible for all errors, whether in the original code or in
its new incarnation.

The original BCPL code can be found in oldbcpl.

A manual for the KRC language and system can be found in doc/krc.1

There is a small collection of example KRC scripts in demo

Bug reports, fixes and comments can be sent to krc@krc-lang.org
